# 💡 Feature Suggestion: Support for Additional Payment Methods

**Project Name:** Demoblaze  
**Module:** Checkout

## 🔍 Description:
Currently, the checkout form only supports **Credit Card** payment. This excludes users who prefer or only use **UPI** or **Cash on Delivery (COD)** — common in Indian markets.

---

## 💡 Suggested Improvement:
Introduce options for:
- UPI (Google Pay, PhonePe, etc.)
- Cash on Delivery
- Net Banking

This will improve user convenience and increase purchase conversion.

## 📝 Notes:
This is not a functional bug, but a user-experience recommendation based on standard e-commerce expectations.
